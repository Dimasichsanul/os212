# TIPS

1. Find Youtube Playlist about WeekXX's Lesson<br>
It will really help you especially when you can't easily understand lesson from slides.

2. Ask Teaching Assistant<br>
Whenever you stuck with something even after GSGS, just ask Teaching Assistant. They will help you. They are very nice people :D.

3. Watch Class Recording from the previous semester<br>
You can ask to Teaching Assistant or search Lecturer's Youtube Account by yourself
